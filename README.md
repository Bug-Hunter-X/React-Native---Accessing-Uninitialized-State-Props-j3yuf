This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state or props before they have been initialized. The error is reproduced in `UninitializedStateProps.js`, and the solution is provided in `UninitializedStatePropsSolution.js`. The solution utilizes optional chaining and conditional rendering to gracefully handle cases where the state or props might not yet be defined.  Ensure you understand asynchronous operations in React and how to effectively manage state to prevent this error.
